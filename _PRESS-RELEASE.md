## Transforming the internet into convenient and accessible media ##

### What we do ###
  > Stout is a mobile application where users can submit traditional webpages (e.g. news articles, wikis, etc.) and listen to that content through headphones or their phone's built-in speakers. As an added benefit, Stout's clean and visually-appealing formatting makes everyday reading a more enjoyable user experience.

### Who uses Stout? ###
  > You're on your way to work when you get a notification about a commercial airplane gone missing. This is world news. Everyone is talking about it. You want to get the latest information, but between navigating your way through busy streets, driving through crowded intersections, or squeezing yourself into the last open seat on the bus, you don't have the time, nor is it safe, to be continually staring at your phone reading tweets and articles. Enter Stout - get the news without having to read about it.
